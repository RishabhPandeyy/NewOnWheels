About The Project

The "OnWheels Mechanic" website is a modern, client-side digital platform designed for a mobile mechanic service operating in Prayagraj. The primary goal is to provide a trustworthy and highly convenient way for customers to get help during a vehicle breakdown or for routine maintenance.

The project avoids heavy frameworks and backend dependencies, focusing on a fast, reliable, and secure user experience built entirely with core web technologies. It serves as a powerful lead-generation tool by funneling all service requests and product inquiries directly to the business's WhatsApp.

Customization

To make this website your own, you will need to update a few key areas:

WhatsApp Number:

SEO & Social Media Meta Tags:

Team Member Emails:

In about.html, update the mailto: links in the "Team Social Links" section for each team member.

Content (Text, Prices, Products):

All text, prices, product names, and service descriptions are written directly in the HTML. You can edit them easily in any code editor.
